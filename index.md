## My Journey

I am a PhD student specialized a subfield of Artificial Intelligence, and therefore, my EB1A are filed without having the formal title of "Dr.". I applied for the EB-1A visa through the Texas Service Center, with premium processing (direct, not following up pp). My application was approved in 10 days. I have over 220 citations, 10 peer-reviewed publications and 40+ paper reviews. I gathered 6 recommendation letters: 1 from a dependent and 5 from independent sources. 

### my preparation

In my journey toward the EB-1A application, I sought advice from several immigration attorneys. A majority of law firms recommended waiting until I amassed over 500 citations before applying for EB-1A. Although I had filed my NIW with an attorney, I realized I had done 80% of the work on my own. Given this experience, I decided to work on my EB-1A application myself for two main reasons:
1. Nobody understands my research as deeply as I do.
2. Engaging an attorney can be expensive, and with my citation count (200+), there was a higher likelihood of receiving an RFE (Request for Additional Evidence).

There are numerous free EB-1A resources available online such as [Andrey Solovyev](https://andreychemist.github.io/story/), [Razvan Marinescu](https://razvanmarinescu.github.io/green-card-I-140/), and [redclock](https://github.com/easydiyeb1a/easydiyeb1a.github.io/blob/main/RedClock_EB1A_CL%2BPL.pdf). However, my case is a bit different from theirs because I do not hold such strong citation records. In my case, I focused on presenting robust evidence under the "original scientific and scholarly contributions of major significance" category. This category often determines if an applicant receives an RFE or denial. Instead of solely relying on support letters to illustrate the impact of my research, I provided detailed and specific examples to highlight its significance. While I also paid for a DIY service to get access to several other EB-1A petitions, I found that most of the information was readily available online, and the provided petition letters weren't particularly useful to my situation.

## EB-1A Criteria

The EB-1A visa category, designated for Aliens of Extraordinary Ability, is a highly coveted immigrant visa preference category for individuals who have demonstrated exceptional expertise and recognition in their respective fields. To qualify, applicants must provide evidence of an extraordinary ability in their discipline and be entering the U.S. to continue work in that area. An approved EB-1A petition may allow for priority in the green card application process. To establish extraordinary ability, applicants must meet at least 3 out of the 10 criteria set by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS):

1. **Evidence of receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence.**
2. **Evidence of your membership in associations in the field which demand outstanding achievement of their members.**
3. **Evidence of published material about you in professional or major trade publications or other major media.**
4. **Evidence that you have been asked to judge the work of others, either individually or on a panel.** (I claimed this)
5. **Evidence of your original scientific, scholarly, artistic, athletic, or business-related contributions of major significance to the field.** (I claimed this)
6. **Evidence of your authorship of scholarly articles in professional or major trade publications or other major media.** (I claimed this)
7. **Evidence that your work has been displayed at artistic exhibitions or showcases.**
8. **Evidence of your performance of a leading or critical role in distinguished organizations.**
9. **Evidence that you command a high salary or other significantly high remuneration in relation to others in the field.**
10. **Evidence of your commercial successes in the performing arts.**

Meeting these criteria does not guarantee visa approval, as the overall application is reviewed holistically by USCIS officers.

## Preparing the Petition Letter

When applying for the **EB-1A (Extraordinary Ability)** category, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) uses a two-step approach to evaluate the petitions. This approach ensures both a thorough and fair evaluation of each applicant's credentials and achievements.


### 1. Initial Criteria Evaluation

In this initial step, the USCIS evaluates the evidence submitted by the petitioner:
- The aim is to determine if the applicant meets at least three out of the ten established criteria for extraordinary ability. This can include evidence such as awards, published materials, and original contributions to the field.
- Meeting three of the criteria does not guarantee approval but qualifies the petitioner for the next step.

### 2. Final Merits Determination

After the preliminary assessment, USCIS delves deeper into the submitted evidence to conclusively judge the applicant's level of extraordinary ability:
- This assessment determines if the evidence presented shows the applicant as someone among the small percentage who've risen to the top of their field.
- The beneficiary must demonstrate consistent acclaim on a national or international scale. It's not enough to have achieved this recognition in the past; it's vital to maintain this high level of acclaim over time.

The introduction of this two-step approach ensures that both the quantity and quality of the evidence are adequately considered. It's possible for an applicant to satisfy criteria in the first step but still face denial in the second if the overall evidence doesn't sufficiently support a claim of extraordinary ability. For potential EB-1A petitioners, it's crucial to put forth a comprehensive case that not only addresses specific criteria but also clearly showcases the petitioner's significant achievements and standing in their field.
