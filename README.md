## EB-1A Criteria

The EB-1A visa category, designated for Aliens of Extraordinary Ability, is a highly coveted immigrant visa preference category for individuals who have demonstrated exceptional expertise and recognition in their respective fields. To qualify, applicants must provide evidence of an extraordinary ability in their discipline and be entering the U.S. to continue work in that area. An approved EB-1A petition may allow for priority in the green card application process. To establish extraordinary ability, applicants must meet at least 3 out of the 10 criteria set by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS):

1. **Evidence of receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence.**
2. **Evidence of your membership in associations in the field which demand outstanding achievement of their members.**
3. **Evidence of published material about you in professional or major trade publications or other major media.**
4. **Evidence that you have been asked to judge the work of others, either individually or on a panel.**
5. **Evidence of your original scientific, scholarly, artistic, athletic, or business-related contributions of major significance to the field.**
6. **Evidence of your authorship of scholarly articles in professional or major trade publications or other major media.**
7. **Evidence that your work has been displayed at artistic exhibitions or showcases.**
8. **Evidence of your performance of a leading or critical role in distinguished organizations.**
9. **Evidence that you command a high salary or other significantly high remuneration in relation to others in the field.**
10. **Evidence of your commercial successes in the performing arts.**

Meeting these criteria does not guarantee visa approval, as the overall application is reviewed holistically by USCIS officers.
